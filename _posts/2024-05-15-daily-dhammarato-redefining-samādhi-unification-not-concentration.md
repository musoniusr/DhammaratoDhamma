### Samādhi vs Concentration

In Buddhist practice, the term samādhi is often mistranslated as concentration. However, this understanding may lead practitioners astray.

"The word samādhi does not translate into the word concentration. The word samādhi translates better as unification or collectiveness, bringing things together to where concentration has to do with focusing down and eliminating things."

The difference between unification and concentration is illustrated through an analogy:

"An example of that would be concentrated milk or frozen concentrated orange juice. And yet frozen concentrated orange juice, you do not drink it [in that concentrated form, you have to make it whole again by adding water] . I mean, it used to be advertised when I was a young man, it was advertised heavily on television. Frozen concentrated orange juice or even concentrated so much they took all the water out and then they called it Tang. But nobody eats Tang by the spoonful, nor does anybody drink frozen, concentrated orange juice like it was ice cream or something."

Just as concentrated orange juice is undrinkable without adding water to make it whole orange juice again, the mind in true samādhi is not forcibly narrowed or restricted. Instead, it is brought together and unified and made whole.

"Now, though, there is a way of calling concentration that we can use it, but it has to have a particular definition to it. And that particular definition has to do with repeating it over and over and over and over again."

And the repeating over and over again, involves being satisfied with the moment.  Saying things to ourselves like...  

- Everything is ok
- everything is alright
- I feel comfortable
- I feel safe
- I feel secure

By redefining samādhi away from concentration, we can approach meditation with the aim of gladdening and unifying the mind rather than forcefully concentrating it. This leads to a state where the mind is "whole" and "clean," free from the junk we often carry.

Discover the true meaning and application of samadhi and find freedom in the present moment.
